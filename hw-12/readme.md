This week I was able to create a functional OOP with objects that interact with each other and with the user. I was able to make the balls in my sketch, but I was having troubles making them react to my input. I had my friend Stephen help me make my balls react to the mouse and bounce away when the mouse goes inside the radius of a ball.

I used techniques from throughout the lesson this week and could create something out of it.

It's been fun learning and working with you Mr. Musick!
