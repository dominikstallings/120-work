# What have I learned this week?

## I practiced how to navigate github and gitbash

-you can use github to develop software or code for compaby
- you can make changes while working with your team
-command: git add and command: git commit -m 'comment here' are vital

1. You use .md files to create code for html5 websites.
2. practicing how to organize your website using html5 is important to understand .md.

That is about it for all the important things that I learned this week, as a reward, [here's one of the most hype songs this summer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUXX55WqYZs)

To prove to Dr. Musick that I am the best coding-hacker around look at this inlined block of code
```
git status
git init
mv C:\users\dominik\documents\120-work\test1.txt\ c:\
git add
git commit -m
```
