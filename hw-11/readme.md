This was the most frustrating exercise I've ever had with this class. Wow, that was just tough, I first of all wanted to make my CUBES, rotate and not just tilted. Secondly, I wanted my cubes to be a culmination of COLORS AND LOVE, but they are just grayscaled. Third of all I wanted some singular boxes running around and not them emerge like a cubesnake from the bottom corner, but I can't figure out this code. It's so hard I can't concentrate anymore.

Other than that, maybe once I'm done crying and finally understand these objects in the future. I'll have a better time, who knows.

Also sorry for handing in my homework late.s
