Arrays: I like them! They have potential to simplify code and make shorten unnecesary words, I'll use them more from now on.

Functions: I'm sure they are useful in many applications but for me personally it just made my code longer without adding any real purpose, perhaps they will be more useful in complex codes in the future. I'm glad I finally got the hang of it!
