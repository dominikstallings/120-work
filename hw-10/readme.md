Let's see,

I was inspired to make a clock mouse after listening to Nicholas Jaar's Killing Time. Everything went well for this assignment, I was able to create each pointer at appopriate speeds and created some numbers to "kill the time". THe only problem I encountered was not being able to create text on my background without getting rid of my numbers. But that was just a little bonus, so I left it out in the final version. 

I also used good readability practices in this assignment so it's much easier to read, actually it's VERY suprising how much easier it is read.

Mr. Musick: you should add that part of this class to the VERY beginning of p5, it's helpful.
