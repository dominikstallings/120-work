I learned that I need a calm head to do good work. Coding while angry is not fun and only gives you marginal progress, I learned that the hard way this week.

Technical: I finally understand the random(); and noise(); functions and how I can play around with them to create different images and animations at random. I still need help with the algorithms though. I had a friend help me figure out my code a little bit to be honest, but it was a good learning experience since he helped me understnad syntax more clearly.

What I want to learn next: How to do math, I haven't had a math class since my freshman year and Math hurts.

PS: This lesson made me want to quit this class like 300 times, but now that I'm done I feel proud and want to stay. Yay!
