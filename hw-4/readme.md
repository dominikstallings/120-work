Dominik Stallings, 50

This is the readme.md file for hw-4

I honestly forget what we are supposed to put into these, so I'll just say this.

I learned how to make a ugly me in code, it was pretty funny but also stressful because I was sick for a large part of the week and unable to get out of bed. (looking at screens is impossible)

I got the assignment done and I'm pretty happy with the outcome, I want to remind myself that taking inspiration and guidance from code posted in the moodle is ok, its not like im literally copy and pasting it. Just using it as guidance.

Also, if Michael is reading this: could you post grades on moodle please? It would be great to gauge my progress in this class, thank you.
