["Hello World!" Sketch](https://dominikstallings.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

1. Basically, I learned how to use basic code to create ellipses, canvases, canvas colors and more general knowledge about p5js.
2. I followed along iwth the videos or did the reading and worked on my own for this week's module.
3. My computer keeps crashing, it probably needs to be cleaned up with some canned air, I might need to get a few new hard drives. A new processor would be nice too. Other than those personal grievances(and a lot of F-bombs dropped) everything was relatively easy to do.
4. I would like to know how that one guy made a flower, how do you stack multiple images on one another?
5. I helped Jack Lawless with his Atom problem.
